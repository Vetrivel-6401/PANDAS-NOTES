Key Differences:

Join Method:
join is primarily used for merging DataFrames based on their indices. 
It behaves similarly to SQL-style joins.

Concatenate Method:
concat is used for stacking DataFrames either vertically (row-wise) or horizontally (column-wise) 
without merging on a specific key.

Flexibility:
join is more suitable for joining tables using a key, while concat is more about stacking or 
combining datasets without merging logic.
